### How do I display an in-situ or satellite dataset on the map?

1. Make sure the main menu is open on the right hand side of the application
2. Click on the **IN-SITU DATASETS** or **SATELLITE DATASETS** tab at the top of the menu
3. For the dataset you are interested in, click on the title of the dataset or on the checkbox on the left side of the list entry
4. The dataset will then load and be displayed on the map and be listed in the **In-Situ Datasets** or **Satellite Datasets** menu in the top-left of the application
5. \[In-Situ\] In the **In-Situ Datasets** menu, click on the wrench icon to open additional view tools for that dataset
6. \[In-Situ\] Click on **Zoom-To Track**

### Where is the in-situ dataset I just turned on?

_Some things to check are are:_

1. The dataset may still loading, this is indicated by a spinning icon next to the dataset item in the **In-Situ Datasets** menu in the top left of the application.
2. If the dataset is loaded, it may be in a different area of the map. To focus on that dataset:
    - In the **In-Situ Datasets** menu, click on the wrench icon to open additional view tools for that dataset
    - Click on **Zoom-To Track**
3. The dataset is colored in such a way as to blend in with the base layer
    - In the **In-Situ Datasets** menu, find the colored dot to left of the dataset label
    - Click on the dot and select an alternate color that contrasts with the background

### Why can't I see a satellite layer?

Most likely the currently selected date does not overlap with the satellite dataset's temporal coverage.

1. Note the time range of the dataset below the dataset's title in the main menu listing
2. Use the date selector in the bottom left of the application to select a date within the dataset's temporal range
