### How do I use this in-situ datasets menu?

First: for this menu to be populated, you must select one or more insitu dataset from the insitu dataset search on the right side of the application.

The **In-Situ Datasets** menu provides controls for viewing selected in-situ datasets on the map. Each item will display:

1. The color of the in-situ dataset on the map
2. The title of the dataset
3. A button to open a menu of controls
4. An **X** for deselecting the dataset and removing it from the map

To open the controls, click the **wrench** icon next to the dataset title. There you will find:

1. A button to view metadata for that dataset
2. A button to pan/zoom the map over the dataset
3. A button to enable the error ellipses for the dataset (may not be available)
4. A button to open the _animation controls_ in the lower left of the application and pre-fill the start and end dates to the date range of the dataset
5. A button to deselect the dataset and remove it from the map
