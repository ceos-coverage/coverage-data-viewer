### The COVERAGE Data Viewer

The COVERAGE Data Viewer was originally developed under the OIIP project. The intent of the application is to bring in-situ and remote sensing datasets into a single application and enable users to explore the data spatially and in more analytical charting formats.

The application is still under development as new sources and formats of data are continually being added.
