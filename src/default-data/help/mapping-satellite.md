### Where is the satellite dataset I just turned on?

_Some things to check are are:_

1. The dataset may still loading. If it takes a very long time, try refreshing the page.
2. If the dataset is loaded, it may be in a different area of the map. Try zooming out to see more of the Earth.
3. The dataset temporal bounds do not intersect the current _selected date_
    - In the **SATELLITE DATASETS** tab of the main menu on the right side of the application, find the list item for the dataset in question
    - Compare the date range in the list to the _selected date_ displayed in the lower left of the application.
    - Change the _selected date_ to a date within the indicated temporal range for the dataset.
