### How do I use this charting menu?

There are two sections of the **CHARTS** tab:

1.  At the top of the tab is the controls to create charts.
    -   Use the dropdowns to select dataset(s) and axis parameters to plot on a chart
    -   Once you've made your selections, click to the **CREATE CHART** button to generate a plot of your selected data
2.  Below the create chart controls will be the list of your created charts

    -   Each time you press **CREATE CHART** a new chart will appear at the top of the list
    -   You can create as many charts as you like
